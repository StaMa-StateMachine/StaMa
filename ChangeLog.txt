
Changes in reverse chronological order:

StaMa 2.3.1
- Build and release automated through AppVeyor
- .NET FWK + NETMF: Checked compatibility with Visual Studio 2015 Community, no changes necessary
- .NET FWK: Upgraded NUnit from 2.6.3 to 3.2.0 and changed "Target framework" for StaMaTest.csproj from ".NET Framework 4 Client Profile" to ".NET Framework 4.5"
- Documentation now hosted on https://StaMa-StateMachine.github.io/StaMa/

StaMa 2.3.0.2
- Adapt Visio files to load in Visio 64-bit version and show a warning about missing code generator functionality. Document the limitation in developers guide.

StaMa 2.3.0.0
- Make sourceState parameter in StateMachineTemplate.Transition configuration method optional.
  This reduces configuration code for simple state machines where the transition source is obvious.
  StaMaShapes.vst adapted to omit sourceState if applicable.
- Uploading of pdb and source to symbolsource.org
- Checked compatibility with Mono and added more advertising statements into Nuget config file.
- Support persisting a state machine through the methods StateMachine.SaveState and StateMachine.Resume which provide saving the current state to a Stream and resuming the StateMachine active state from persisted data.
- Adapted unit tests to run in the NETMF simulator for NETMF and in NUnit 2.6.3 for .NET Framework.

StaMa 2.2.0.2
- Make StaMa.dll for .NET Framework a portable assembly to allow its use in Silverlight and Windows Phone applications. 

StaMa 2.2.0.1
- Provide StaMa.dll as a NuGet package.

StaMa 2.2.0.0
- StaMaShapes/Codegen: Suppress duplicate code output when generating lists of event signals.
- Fix unintended execution of transitions in orthogonal regions when the region was already exited through a transition of an earlier orthogonal region.
- Added documentation, see StaMaDevelopersGuide.chm.
- Added support for Do-Actions in StaMa and Visio shapes.
- Changed usage of the compilaton symbol MF_FRAMEWORK_VERSION_V4_2 in the code to the more generic MF_FRAMEWORK and defined it in the .csproj
- Changed the term "Activity" to "Action" (Entry-Action, Exit-Action, Do-Action, Transition-Action). If this causes trouble with legacy implementations, please try compiling StaMa with the STAMA_COMPATIBLE21 compilaton symbol defined.

StaMa 2.1.0.0
- Ported to .NET Micro Framework (StaMaNETMF.sln, StaMa\StaMaNETMF.csproj). See #if MF_FRAMEWORK_VERSION_V4_2. Added sample for NETMF (Samples\TicketVendingNETMF\TicketVendingNETMF.csproj).
- Replaced trace events with delegate properties.
- RegionCollection, StateCollection, TransitionCollection now implement ICollection<T> to support LINQ.
- Throw new StateMachineException instead of InvalidOperationException wherever state machine syntactic or semantic checks fail.
- Added CODE_ANALYSIS to project and fixed/suppressed corresponding warnings, mainly change from uint to int.
- Update .csproj to VisualStudio 2010.
